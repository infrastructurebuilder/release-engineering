# Parameterized

Parameterization is the mechanism of extracting specific parts of configuration from some executive process and providing a means for supplying those parts differently according to different circumstances.

This is most notable in software development, where a nominal "function" might be defined as a "process that returns some result based on it's parameters".

This same effect applies to [[release engineering]], [[build management]], and the [[deployment]] process.  When properly parameterized, a specific build or deployment could perform very differently, based on those parameters.

## Predictability
Note that parameterization appears to fly in the face of a desire for deterministic outcomes.  This is not entirely true, though.  The key is "proper" parameterization.
