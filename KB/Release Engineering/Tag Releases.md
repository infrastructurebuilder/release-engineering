Tag Releases

Tags: #TODO

Tag releases are just that.  The release is a tag in some source code management system and is generally referred to by that tag.  This started many years ago as a means for easy management of code by developers and is relatively popular in a number of languages and build systems.

And the [[InfrastructureBuilder]] team hates it.
