Roles, especially within the [[security]] context, and requirements and responsibilities that some entity performs.  For instance, the "Security Officer" is a role, which specific duties, and "Chief Executive Officer" is a role.  So are "custodian", "tester", and "developer".  Each of these roles tend to have very different but occasionally overlapping concerns.
