# Release Engineering

Release Engineering (occasionally referred to as RelEng) is the discipline concerned with the identification and availability of releasable [[definitions#Artifact|artifacts]].

As a general rule, people hate this work.  If you don't hate this work, you're probably weird.  It tends to be tedious and robotic.  It also tends to have a lot of rules that, once broken, are hard to re-establish.

It is a generally good idea to acquaint yourself with the [[definitions]] that will be used within this knowledge base.

Release Engineering can be split into a few parts:

- [[Build Management]]
- [[Dependency Management]]
- [[Artifact Management]]
- [[Artifact Management#Dispensation|Artifact Delivery]] (which is usually rolled into Artifact Management)
