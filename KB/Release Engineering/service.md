# Services

A "service" in release engineering terms is some known, [[availability|available]], [[environment]] that serves some well-defined function.  This encompasses most software environments, such as web-servers, database servers, and source code management systems.

Usually, when people refer to "services" in general, it could mean any available provided capability.  In specific, software services most often come as a network TCP/IP endpoint at a known named location that can accept some well-formatted request and produce some expected action or result.
