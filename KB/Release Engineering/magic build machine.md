# Magic Build Machine

A magic build machine is a specialized [[build environment]].  The specialization of the environment is this:
- it is capable of performing a [[build]] of some set of needed code
- it is incapable of being properly replicated

Make no mistake:  having to rely on a magic build machine is a Very Bad Thingâ„¢.

## Rationale
During the course of building a [[build environment]], it is important to remember that most systems are [[ephemeral]] -- that at some point in the future, they will disappear.  Therefore, it is often in one's best interest to be able to replicate such an [[environment]] from scratch in the event that the environment in question dies.  The most efficient way to do this is to create the environment with [[IAC]] code that allows easy reproduction of the local configuration.  A far less attractive, but also generally easier way, is with backups of the original.


## Why So Serious?
It would be reasonable to ask why this topic has its own page.  The answer is simple: because across the course of decades and probably hundreds of locations, the authors have never known of ***any*** place that had _zero_ instances of magic build machines.  These machines were not always _essential_, but they were always there.
