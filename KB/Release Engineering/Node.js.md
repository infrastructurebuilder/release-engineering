# Node

Node is a [[JavaScript]]-based framework that runs on Chrome's V8 engine.  It has a number of functions. 

> As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

## NPM

Node utilizes the Node Package Manager as a means for acquiring [[dependency|dependencies]].  NPM maintains a [central repository](https://www.npmjs.com/) of packages, similar to [[Maven#Maven Central|Maven Central]] and [[PyPi]].
