# Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is a build tool maintained by the [[ASF]].

## Maven Central

Most (well-managed) Java open-source libraries get placed in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).  At present, there are just under 500,000 unique artifacts in Central, with approximately 8 million different versions.

Other types of repositories exist, such as BinTray, and many services provide a proxy for services like Maven Central.
