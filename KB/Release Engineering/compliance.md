Compliance
===

Compliance is a term generally associated with [[configuration management]] and especially [[security]] concerns.  

In simple terms, an [[environment]] has specific requirements.  If those requirements are not fulfilled, the [[environment]] is non-compliant.

Non-compliant and non-functional __*may*__ be, but are __*not necessarily*__, synonymous.  Often, non-functional [[configuration management]] criteria are applied to an [[environment]] to increase its [[observability]] or [[security]], but are not strictly necessary to ensure its functional utility.
