# Compliance

Compliance is a term generally associated with [[configuration management]] and especially [[security]] concerns.

In simple terms, a [[target asset]], like some [[environment]], has specific requirements.  If those requirements are not fulfilled, the [[environment]] is non-compliant.  In the case of a security [[audit]], the requirements are those stipulated by some [[policy]].

Non-compliant and non-functional **_may_** be, but are **_not necessarily_**, synonymous.  Often, non-functional [[configuration management]] criteria are applied to an [[environment]] to increase its [[observability]] or [[security]], but are not strictly necessary to ensure its functional utility.
