# HIPAA Privacy Rule

Per [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html):

> HHS published a final [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html) in December 2000, which was later modified in August 2002. This Rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard health care transactions electronically.  Compliance with the Privacy Rule was required as of April 14, 2003 (April 14, 2004, for small health plans).
