# HITECH

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ([HITECH Act]((http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HITECH-Act))) was [signed into law](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/HITECH-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) bill in 2009.

The HITECH Act was created to drive the adoption and “meaningful use” of electronic health records (EHR) technology by U.S.-based healthcare providers and their business associates. Meaningful use means healthcare providers need to show that they are using certified EHR technology in a way that can be measured in both quantity and quality.
