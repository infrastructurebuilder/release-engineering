Similar breach notification provisions implemented and enforced by the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/health-privacy/health-breach-notification-rule), apply to vendors of personal health records and their third party service providers, pursuant to section 13407 of the HITECH Act.
