# HIPAA

The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/health-insurance-portability-and-accountability-act-1996) was enacted to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the US health care system.

Compliance with HIPAA mandates is usually a condition of continued employment with healthcare companies and falls under two main categories:

- [[HIPAA Privacy Rule]]
- [[HIPAA Security Rule]]
