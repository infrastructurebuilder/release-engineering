# Recovery Time Objective

An RTO is the target time to recover from an outage or service interruption.  It is generally experessed one of two ways:
- A time in units ("5 minutes") for 100% return to service
- A series of percentages of service over time.
	- eg ("50% response time within 1 hour, 100% within 5 hours")
