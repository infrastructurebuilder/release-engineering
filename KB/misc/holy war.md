# Baseless Subjective Conflict

tl;dr -> There are some vanishingly small number of "right answers" in the world and the answer you have faith in probably isn't one of them.  It generally depends on the context.

A nominal "holy war" in technology is some dispute over [a] decision[s] about tools, practices, methodologies, etc.  

Some notable holy wars include
- `emacs` vs `vi`
- `function programming` vs `non-functional`
- build vs buy
- Mac vs Windows

You get the idea. 

It all frequently boils down to "your way" vs. "my way".

To be clear, there exist _very few_ objectively correct answers in the universe, and even fewer in technology.  Almost all of these conflicts are rooted in personal preference for given axes of subjective value.  Even when one side of an argument can be seen to be somehow superior to some other side, it is often the case at the expense of some other axis of value, which may subjectively hold greater sway for other parties.

This does _not_ mean that one tool, type, technique, or method does not hold general value over another.  Many people can make a very valid argument that [[Microsoft]]s `.NET` framework has numerous bad attributes that make it unsuitable for [insert their application here].  However, if your team is all a set of `.NET` experts, then `.NET` is probably the best way get results.  Again, it all depends on the context (and/or constraints) of the situation.
