# Service Level Agreement

An SLA is an agreement that defines the type and quality of service that a consumer could expect from a given entity or service.

It is:
>  a commitment between a [service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider "Service provider") and a [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer "Customer"). Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in [[MTBF][ , [[MTTR]]; identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput "Throughput"); [jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter "Jitter"); or similar measurable details. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement)
