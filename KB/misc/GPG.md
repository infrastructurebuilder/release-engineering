# GPG
[Gnu Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/) is a tool for producing assymmetric keys (Public/Private keypairs).  This is widely regarded as one of the "right ways" to encrypt data, as the public part is public but the private part remains private.

Note that GPG (and assymmetric encryption) is not intrinsically more secure than a well-guarded password (a symmetric key).  A variety of elements make up the overall security of any encryption, and the key management is simply a part of this.
