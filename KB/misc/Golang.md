# Golang

A C-like language with a garbage collector created by Google.  


## Executable
Golang produces a statically linked binary on the platforms that it supports (primarily [[Linux]], [[MacOSX]], and [[Microsoft#Windows]])

## Library

Since all code is statically compiled into a compile-time-linked executable, a Golang "library" is a namespaced piece of code that can be _included_ in another build, and fetched using `go get`.
