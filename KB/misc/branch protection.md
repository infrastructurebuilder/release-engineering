# Branch Protection

[[GitHub]] and other [[source code]] management providers often manage their repositories using [[branch]]es.

The mechanisms that are in place to prevent who can commit to or read from those branches are "branch protection".

Branch protection usually comes in the form of "this group or person may commit to this branch" or "this group or person is required to do some act in order to commit to this branch".
