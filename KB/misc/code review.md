# Code Review

A [code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) is an examination of some existing body of code, usually along the lines of quality.  The review is the examination, but the more relevant part are the elements under examination.

Common elements include:
- formatting
- secure coding practices
- standardize coding practices
- introduction or removal of [[dependency|dependencies]]

The linked [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) defines several others.

The elements under examination should be properly defined prior to the beginning a code review.  As a general rule, a code review typically examines _changed_ elements of code, although this is not universal (and is frequently ill-advised, since it might ignore inadvertently introduced error).
