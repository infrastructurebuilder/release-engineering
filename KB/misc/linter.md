# Code Linting

A "linter" is a program that checks the format of other source code for "correctness", defined by some standard or arbitrary designation.  For instance, [[Golang]] has the `go fmt` command, as does [[Terraform]].  

Other programming languages have other tools to perform linting processes.  [[Python]] can be made to "compile" the `.pyc` files of a program, so if the compilation step fails then the "linting" process fails.
