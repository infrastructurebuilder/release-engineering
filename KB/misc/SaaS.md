SasS offerings are means for providing a software product in an easily consumable format without the worry of having to install, provision, or administrate the underlying packages themselves.

Sometimes SaaS offerings can bump up against organizational [[third-party requirements]].

Having some sort of third-party management mechanism in place generally reduces the [[risk]] associated with dealing with outside entities.
