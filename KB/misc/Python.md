# Python

Python is an interpreted, duck-typing scripting language created by Guido van Rossum.

## Library

Python libraries are packaged and usually managed through `setuptools`, a built-in tool in Python installations.  They typically get stored in [[PyPi]], the Python central repository.

## Executable

A Python executable is just a top-level script that gets executed within the shell (i.e. `python mycoolprogram`)
