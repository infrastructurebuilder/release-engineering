# Penetration Test

A penetration test ("pen test") is a test in the form of [generally active] attempts by an entity to achieve access to an existing system by circumventing existing flaws in system or infrastructure [[security]].

The purpose of the test is to expose those flaws and allow the testers to compile a list of [[remediation]]s for the purpose of closing such holes.
