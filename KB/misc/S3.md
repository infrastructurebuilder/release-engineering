# Simple Storage Service

This is a service of [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) providing distributed storage and 11 9's of availabilty.

The location of storage is a "bucket".  Buckets are DNS-named endpoints, and thus must be uniqure across the DNS zone of the service.

S3 is geographically centralized.

By default, it is accessed across the public internet.  This can be modified within AWS by using a [[VPC#VPC Endpoint|VPC Endpoint]].

It has storage lifecycles, which can migrate data to less-frequent use categories with lower costs.

## Presigned URL
It is possible to produce a "presigned" URL for S3 transfer. These URLs have expiration dates and can be used as an endpoint for someone to transfer data directly into your S3 buckets.
