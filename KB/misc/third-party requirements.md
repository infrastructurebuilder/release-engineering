# Third-Party Requirements

Third parties are members who are not a part of a given organization and not that organization's consumers/customers.  

Third parties are often subject to some "third-party requirement" or "third-party agreement" which is a form of contractual management allowing a given organization to apply [[sanctions]] to the third party in the event of a breach of contract.
