# Audit

An audit is a form of general query against the existential state of some target system that determines if that entity conforms to required criteria.  

The target of the audit is what is being audited.

The required criteria are usually some policy that either is or is not being followed properly.

The audit is meant to determine if the policy is being followed, and often involves generating planned work to perform [[remediation]].

Effectively, an audit takes a policy and determines if some target system, group, organization, or artifact complies with that policy.  If not, then the differences are iterated, along with possible changes that need to be done in order to achieve compliance with the policy (i.e. the [[remediation]]s).
