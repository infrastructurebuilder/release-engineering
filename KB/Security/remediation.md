# Remediation

A remediation is a change that needs to be performed in order to take an [[audit]]'s [[target asset]] into [[compliance]] with a [[policy]].

It can be as simple as changing a color for red to blue, or as complex as a full rearchitecture of a huge system.

A remediation has a specific [[policy]] that was violated, and there should be some specific set of instructions about how to make the [[target asset]] [[compliance|compliant]].
